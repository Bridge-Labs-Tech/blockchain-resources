# Blockchain-resources
This repository contains Blockchain resouces that can be useful to anyone getting started in blockchain development.

## Getting Started
- You will need some programming experience in any language.
- Knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript is a must have as this is the most common way of interacting with smart contracts.
- Solidity is a JavaScript-like programming language that is strongly typed hence knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript will get you up and running in no time.
- Read the articles/resource under ***Good Read*** to have a better understanding of Blockchain, web3 and related topics as this will greatly help you in the process of builing decentralized apps.
- You will need a blockchain wallet that enables you to interact with blockchains. The most popular is [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- You need an Ethereum development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software. My favorite is [HardHat](https://hardhat.org) but we also have [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/)
